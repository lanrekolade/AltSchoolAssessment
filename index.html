    <p> 
        <strong> Ewa Agoyin is a beloved Yoruba delicacy. 
        It is a richly flavoured pepper sauce served with soft, well cooked beans.</p>
        <p>Growing up in Lagos, this was a staple breakfast in many homes including mine and </br>
        sometimes we added fried plantain and fried fish and the combination was unforgettable.</p>

        The Yoruba truly know how to elevate a simple dish like they did with beans.</br>
        This regular stew and then theres this special Yoruba pepper sauce made specially for the beans.
        A flavour all on its own

    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Dried Chili</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Bell</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>Seasoning & Spices</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>How To Prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick out the specks of dirt from the beans, rinse and drain the beans a couple of times.</li>
        <li> Pour the beans in a stockpot, add the water and cook till it becomes very tender for about 2 to 2½ hours.</li>
        <li>Use a Potato Masher or a wooden spoon to mash the Beans to your preference</li>
        <li>Rehydrate the dried Chilies and bell peppers by soaking them in water overnight or pour hot boiling water over them for about 2 hours</li>
        <li>Blend the rehydrated Peppers with the onions, ginger, and about a quarter cup of water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the Palm oil in a pan on medium heat until the oil is very hot but not bleached.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onion and let it cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. We want it browned and not black or burnt.</li>
        <li>Stir in the blended peppers and cook for about 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the seasoning cubes, crayfish, and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Leave it to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes; by this time, the color of the pepper would have changed from bright red to dark red. If not, cook for some additional time.</li>
        <li>Serve the Sauce over the Ewa Agoyin (Ewa Aganyin) or eat with your Agege Bread and Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

        <em>
        <li>I used Black Eyed Peas for this recipe because it's my preference, feel free to use the Nigerian honey Beans (Ewa Oloyin) if that's what you like.</li>
        <li>Agoyin tends to dry out fast once it's mashed, and the colder it gets, the drier it appears, so adjust the water level as required.</li>
        <li>You don't have to bleach the Palm Oil you will use for cooking making the Sauce, once it's very hot it's okay</li>
